# Efficient learning approach

An efficient learning approach derived from my own experience and mistakes while researching and reading various documentations.



## Get used to be confused

When I approach new problem i'm not familiar with it and i expect to be confused.
When I get confused I am scared of the problem and I can't think straight because of it.

When I was trying to use ngrx effects which I don't know I was telling myself:

  - "It is ok to be confused"
  - "I don't need to understand it"
  - "I just need to copy this code untill it works"
  - "After it starts working I can learn more about it"

With this approach, when the code runs, I am more confident about myself and know how to write it next time.
This allows me to learn faster because the biggest problem is the "general confusion" and "uncomfortable feeling" when it is new to me, like in this case NGRX.



## Follow the steps exactly as written

This is applied ALWAYS when a tool is absolutely new.
Whenever I skipped steps told in for example, NGRX setup, it didn't work.

It is important to follow every single small step and read every single line of text
and do exactly what it tells.



## Google terms I don't understand

Every time I go through documentation for new tool,
I google terms that are used that I don't understand.

First time I was learning ReactJS everything in documentation was new and I didn't understand it.

These are general steps that I follow.

1. I was confused
2. I followed every single step as documentation wrote
3. I googled every new unknown term after code worked



## I followed steps, but code doesn't work

I go back to start and remind myself of this: "Don't be confused & Don't need to understand. Follow the steps in tutorial again."

From experience every documentation to get started, like NGRX, has proper steps and they work.
If I followed all the steps and it does not work, it means I made a mistake.



## I will never find where my mistake was

Going through what I wrote to compare it with documentation is NOT an option.
If I don't know what I write, how can I know where is mistake?

I have to go from the step 0, follow everything from 0 to hero again.

If nothing works again, I try 3rd time.
After that, if nothing works, documentation may have missed details.



## Find new resource

At this point documentation expects already existing knowledge.

Now I start searching for blog posts or tutorials on this same topic.



## New resource doesn't work

I find a new resource then.



## Code finally runs, compare it to documentation

Documentation is big and explains in detail how to use the tool, like NGRX in previous examples.

Now I compare what I have working to what is written in documentation, search for differences.



## Modification time, change code from blog post, to what is in documentation

Now, I need to write the code like documentation wants me to write it.
At this point I understand where I made mistake and what documentation didn't explain.

Now I follow documentation through, and usualy everything will work from this point on.



## I have working code, change it to do what i want ( **Parallel coding** )

Now, I have code that documentation has and it works.
I want to make modification to make it work what I want.

If NGRX in documentation fetches books and adds book to the state.
I will fetch some other api, like npms.io and add it to state.


Parallel programming means, mirroring what they have written.
I change lines of code that are obvious.

Does their NGRX effect have a url? Do I know it fetches URL?
I change URL to my own.



## Parallel Coding

This is an approach where I copy everything from documentation, then change some lines of code to do something else.
An example of this is store different string in ngrx state, fetch different api.

How do I know where and what to change? I just try and pray it works, otherwise i do code drilling, where I print out values in existing code.
This way I will find out what I need to change.



## Inspect the code inside, use console.log, print out data

This is really important because to change the code, I need to understand it.
This is basically drilling and it is important for improvement.

If I don't drill their code, I won't understand it, I can't change it and I can't use it.



## Conclusion

These are some general steps I follow and 90% of time I follow them in exactly this order.

I might have overlooked some details because this process is very familiar and close to me.
If anything wasn't explained well or there is missing details or something needs
more explaination, tell me so I can add it to this.



### Final note

I understand that it will be difficult to follow this, as it may be abstract like following documentation.
But I believe that applying this approach yields great results, at least it does for me.
Anyway, as any tool can be learned how to use, this can probably too.
